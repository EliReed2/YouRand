# **YouRand Youtube Extension**

**Summary:** 

YouRand is a Chrome extension that lets you discover random YouTube videos tailored to your interests.
While watching a video, YouRand adds a “Save Video” button directly to the YouTube interface. Clicking it saves information about the current video, allowing YouRand to learn what topics you enjoy. You can then generate a completely random video based on your saved interests and tags which gives you something new to watch every time.

**Purpose:**

YouRand was created to solve a simple frustration: opening YouTube and seeing recommendations that don’t match what you’re actually in the mood for.
With YouRand, you can take control of your discovery experience and choose specific topics you like, and let the extension serve you a truly random video you haven’t seen before. It’s a fun and personalized way to explore YouTube beyond the algorithm.

**Tech Stack:**
