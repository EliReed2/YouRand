# **YouRand Youtube Extension**

**Summary:** 
YouRand is a chrome extension that allows users to randomly generate a youtube video based off of their interests. When watching a youtube video, YouRand adds a save video button to your UI that saves video info from the video you are currently watching. YouRand then uses this info to create tags the user can pick from when deciding what topic they would like for their random video.

**Purpose:**
I frequently found myself opening Youtube and having my reccomendations be centered around content I wasn't interested in or wasn't what I was looking for at the time. So, I decided to make YouRand so I could pick out certain topics and generate a RANDOM video I had not seen before so I would have something to watch.
